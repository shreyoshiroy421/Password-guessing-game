**State Management:** Tracks user attempts and provides real-time feedback on remaining tries.

**Attempt Limit:** Integrated a 5-attempt constraint to increase game difficulty and stakes.

**Case Sensitivity Handling:** Automatically sanitizes user input to ensure a smooth user experience regardless of capitalization.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated

 **Randomization:** Utilization of the random module to ensure a unique "secret" every session.
 
 **String Formatting:** Use of f-strings for dynamic data display.
 
 **Error Handling:** Logic to handle invalid inputs by defaulting to a safe game state.
